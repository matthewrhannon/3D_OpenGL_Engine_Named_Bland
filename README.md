# 3D_OpenGL_Engine_Named_Bland
Bland Engine was the second OpenGL 2.1 graphics engine I wrote. It has text, entities, skybox, and more. Language is C++ and Win32.

This OpenGL based graphics engine was the second one I created. It was originally meant to be a bigger
and better version of the first however the eye of development could not keep up with its reach. Bland
Engine was never completed, and there remain various scattered placeholder source files for
functionality that was never implemented. Some examples include terrain, octree, geomipmapping, and
GUI.

Some features that were developed were the engine hierarchy, text rendering, timer class, texture
system w/ various image formats, camera class, frustum class, object handler, and a skybox.
Usage

Controls available are keys W, S, A, D to move around; and the mouse to move the view.
This program was developed to run on Windows XP. Some dependencies that are required are at
minimum OpenGL 2.1 runtime files. Also the Glaux.dll is included in the binary folder.
